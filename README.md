This project has a mp4 video that is shown in the header of the page, too weight to push it in the reposity.

In order to see the mp4 video properly you can download it from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13s1N4EosR_jeOHla3ENZUqoxZZdgxN44/view?usp=sharing

Create the path "src/assets/video" and put the .mp4 in it.
